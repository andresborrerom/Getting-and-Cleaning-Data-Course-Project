Getting and Cleaning data course project

Important comments:

1. The column names were edited to what the first lecture of the week 4 lectures explained as "appropriate" on its last page.
2. The program asks for you to save the unzipped folder in your working directory.
3. The program will create a txt file in your working directory, which can be read with "read.csv"
